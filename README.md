# Deep Learning Based Inverse Kinematics Algorithm for Robotics Trajectory Planning

 This is the final project for UCLA 2025 Winter Electrical and Computer Engineering 147-Deep Learning and Neural Network Project

 To use the code, train your network by running predict_2d_FCN.py, predict_ResNet.py, or transformer.py

 To use the DLS, go to DLSP.py. To use regression, go to regression.py

 NN stored in net_new.py

 To see the resulting model's performance on human trajectory, go to human_traj_verification. If you don't want to see the number but want the gif, define an endpoint and uncomment the part of code.
